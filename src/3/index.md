### Cake Pattern Problem

At this point pur function helloWorld is testable and explicit, but it's kind of bad-looking and verbose.

Even worse composing it with other function becomes hard.

We would like to express both the dependencies and the failure type in a single return type that compose better.

1) Progamming to a interface, not against a concreate implementation (runtime)
  ```shell
    yarn file src/3/1.ts
  ``` 
2) Composing
  ```shell
    yarn file src/3/2.ts
  ```

3) Composing with generators
  ```shell
    yarn file src/3/3.ts
  ```
